								<p style="font-size:1.5em;">Unlimited Opportunities for a Memorable Experience.</p>
								<p>You will be hunting in south east Nebraska targeting birds migrating from Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge in Mound City, Missouri to the Rainwater Basins here in Nebraska. My blinds are comfortable heated above ground blinds built to blend into the background of the cornfields of NE. A typical hunt will be opportunities at birds that have roosted in the area as they go out to feed. At some point in the am when you get hungry your guide will cook a hot breakfast for everyone in the blind. Between 10am and 2pm is when some of the best migration typically happens and then past 2 we start to get into the birds looking for a place to roost for the night. You will be hunting in what feels like a sea of white.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/old.jpg" alt="Vintage painting of hunting" /></span>
								<p style="font-size:1.5em;">Lots of Snow Geese, Comfortable Space</p>
								<p>Thousands of snow goose decoys placed around you in every direction moving in the wind. All of the decoys are top of the line and new every year. I have several kinds of flyers, flappers, bouncers, and rotary machines. The ecallers are custom built with custom made tracks of actual feeding geese. This is a professional outfit with countless hours and dollars going into you having a successful hunt.<br></p>
								<p>
								The spring snow goose conservation order allows for unplugged guns, electronic calls, extended shooting hours, and no limits so bring plenty of shells. Always better to have too many than not enough. You will not have to carry anything to the blind and space is not an issue</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/spread_blind.jpg" alt="snow goose Spread and blind" /></span>
								<p style="font-size:1.5em;">Our History, Background, and Experience</p>
								<p>​My name is Phil Ellsworth, owner/operator of Ellsworth’s Outsiders Outdoors. I was brought up in small town Nebraska spending my weekends as a kid hunting every kind of game I possibly could. Before I could drive I was grabbing my ole trusty rusty 870 and walking creeks, draws, and old train tracks just outside of town. I cut my duck teeth on the famous Platte River.<br> Back then it was just my brother and I in a make shift blind built out of what ever wood we could scrounge up. Nobody else in my family “messed with” ducks or geese. We had a lot of very tough years. Just upstream of us was a blind of old timers. These two guys really hated the 2 dumb kids downstream with the junk equipment and the freebie blind. Right down stream of us were two other old timers who felt basically the same way. For years we were lucky to get any of their leftovers. We didn’t have a chance. There was no internet to guide and teach us. Year after year we learned. Year after year we got better until the tables were turned. These two blinds of veteran waterfowl hunters were now getting our leftovers. Before that nasty river took our island and our blind everyone in the area knew who we were and where we hunted.</p>

								<p style="font-size:1.5em;">How Outsiders Outdoors Was Born</p>
								<p>As time went on they started the Spring Conservation Order. No limits, unplugged guns, extended hours. I knew this was something I had to try. I had only had minor success hunting snows in the fall with mouth calls. This new season was easy success for lots of hunters. Personally I had all kinds of problems. One year an actual tornado came through the spread. I was picking decoys up for miles. As with fall waterfowl hunting I eventually figured these birds out too. I worked as a guide for Ron Weineke @ Thunder Hill Guide Service. I learned a lot of the do’s and don’ts about guiding from Ron. When Ron decided to get out of the business I decided to get into it and Outsiders Outdoors was born. Ron has since passed and I think about him every time I go to thunder hill. I have kept his old lease as one of mine that I still guide on to this day</p>
